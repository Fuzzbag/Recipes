    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>10-12 ounces ribeye steak</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>2 tbsp olive Oil</li>
        <li>1/2 sweet onion, sliced</li>
        <li>1/2 green pepper, sliced</li>
        <li>1/2 red pepper, sliced</li>
        <li>2 ounces provolone cheese</li>
        <li>2 hoagie rolls, toasted</li>
        <li>1/4 cup Cheez Whiz, warm</li>
        <li>Fresh thyme,for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place steak in the freezer on a sheet pan for about 10 minutes so it gets very cold but not frozen through.
            Trim off any large pieces of fat normally around the edges of the steak, but some veins of fat in the middle of the steak are good. Slice the steak as thin as possible with a sharp knife. You won’t be able to get it paper thin without a meat slicer, but think of thick deli cut meat. Season steak with salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>In a large skillet set over medium heat, add 1 tablespoon of olive oil along with sliced onions and peppers. Season with 1/4 teaspoon salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions and peppers have softened and start to caramelize around the edges, 12 to 15 minutes. Don’t rush them!</li>
        <li>Heat a griddle or large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil and the sliced steak. Spread out the steak in the skillet in a thin even layer so it covers as much surface area as possible. Cook for a minute or two and then stir to finish cooking the steak. It might need another minute or two, but it will cook very quickly.</li>
        <li>Turn heat down to low on the steak and add the peppers and onions to the steak mixture and stir to combine. Add the provolone slices to the top of the steak mixture and let the cheese melt. Stir to combine, once the cheese has melted.</li>
        <li>Evenly scoop the cheesesteak mixture into the toasted hoagie rolls. The hoagie rolls should be packed! Optionally, drizzle the cheesesteaks with warm Cheez Whiz for maximum cheesiness. Sprinkle fresh thyme over top and serve. </li>
    </ol>
